# Assignment-5

This repository includes two Python programs that demonstrate the use of dictionaries and list slicing in Python:

### Task 1: Dictionary of Student Marks
- Creates a dictionary with student names as keys and their marks as values.
- Prompts the user to enter a student’s name.
- Retrieves and displays the student’s marks.
- If the student is not in the dictionary, displays an appropriate message.

### Task 2: List Slicing and Reversing
- Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
- Extracts the first five elements using slicing.
- Reverses the sliced list.
- Prints both the extracted and reversed lists.
